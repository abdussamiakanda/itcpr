              We are thrilled to announce a major milestone for ITCPR — our first research paper
              has been published!
            </p>

            <p>
              What began as a casual conversation in January 2024 has grown into a thriving
              initiative dedicated to supporting emerging researchers. ITCPR, though still an
              unofficial group, has taken its first concrete step toward becoming a hub for
              innovation in plasmonics and nanophotonics.
            </p>

            <p>
              This groundbreaking achievement comes thanks to the incredible efforts of <b>Tonmoy
              Malaker</b>, <b>Nourin Nurain Amina</b>, and <b>Md Faiyaz Bin Hassan</b>. With guidance, mentorship,
              and sheer determination, this team transformed an idea into impactful research —
              culminating in the publication of their paper in a peer-reviewed journal.
            </p>

            <p>
              Read the Paper: <a href="//doi.org/10.1007/s11468-025-02817-8" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1007/s11468-025-02817-8</a>
            </p>

            <p>
              Though ITCPR isn't officially registered yet, our name proudly appears in the
              acknowledgment section. It's a symbolic beginning — a promise of what's to come.
              We aim to open doors for students and early-career researchers who may not always
              have access to traditional academic pathways.
            </p>

            <p>
              To celebrate this accomplishment and inspire further curiosity, we invite you to
              a public talk exploring the themes of our research:
            </p>
