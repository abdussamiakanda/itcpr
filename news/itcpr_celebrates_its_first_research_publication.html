        We are thrilled to announce a major milestone for ITCPR — our first research paper
        has been published!
        <br />
        <br />
        What began as a casual conversation in January 2024 has grown into a thriving
        initiative dedicated to supporting emerging researchers. ITCPR, though still an
        unofficial group, has taken its first concrete step toward becoming a hub for
        innovation in plasmonics and nanophotonics.
        <br />
        <br />
        This groundbreaking achievement comes thanks to the incredible efforts of <b>Tonmoy
        Malaker</b>, <b>Nourin Nurain Amina</b>, and <b>Md Faiyaz Bin Hassan</b>. With guidance, mentorship,
        and sheer determination, this team transformed an idea into impactful research —
        culminating in the publication of their paper in a peer-reviewed journal.
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        Though ITCPR isn't officially registered yet, our name proudly appears in the
        acknowledgment section. It's a symbolic beginning — a promise of what's to come.
        We aim to open doors for students and early-career researchers who may not always
        have access to traditional academic pathways.
        <br />
        <br />
        To celebrate this accomplishment and inspire further curiosity, we invite you to
        a public talk exploring the themes of our research:

        will delve into the future potential of nanophotonics, quantum optics, and plasmonic
        technologies.
        <br />
        <br />
        Let's celebrate this exciting chapter in ITCPR's journey and spark new discussions
        in the world of advanced physics. This is just the beginning!
