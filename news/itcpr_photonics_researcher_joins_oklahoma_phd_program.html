              We are excited to share a proud moment for the ITCPR community. <b>Tonmoy Malakar</b>, a dedicated
              researcher with ITCPR's Photonics Group and a graduate of our internship program, has been
              offered admission to the PhD program at <b>The University of Oklahoma</b>, United States.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tonmoy joined ITCPR as an intern in 2024, quickly standing out for his sharp research skills,
              enthusiasm, and collaborative spirit. His internship laid the groundwork for a deeper
              engagement with the Photonics Research Group, where he was promoted to a member ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
              The University of Oklahoma - known for its cutting-edge research in photonics and materials
              science - recognized Tonmoy's potential and offered him a place in their doctoral program.
              This marks a significant milestone in his academic journey and is also a proud reflection
              of the mentorship and research environment we foster at ITCPR.
            </p>
            <p>
              At ITCPR, Tonmoy has been involved in various research projects, including designing advanced
              photonic sensors and exploring photonic crystals for optical applications in sensors. His work
              has not only advanced our research goals but also inspired fellow researchers within our community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tonmoy's contributions - particularly in photonic simulations, and photonic crystal
              design - have earned recognition through publications and collaborative projects
              under the ITCPR banner. His work reflects both his personal dedication and the collaborative
              ethos we nurture across our research groups.
            </p>
            <p>
              His profile is outlined below:
