            <h2>Program Overview</h2>
            <p>
              Dive into our vibrant year-long internship at ITCPR, where you'll immerse yourself
              in cutting-edge theoretical and computational physics research while receiving
              regular guidance and feedback.
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>First 3 months - Foundations & Skill-Building:</b> Begin with an intensive
                  training block focused on essential concepts, coding and data-analysis tools, and
                  good research practices. Activities include guided lectures, paper-reproduction
                  exercises, and literature reviews—everything you need to speak the language of
                  modern physics research.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Monthly evaluations, year-round:</b> At the end of every month you'll meet with
                  mentors to review your progress, set fresh goals, and make sure your learning path
                  stays on track.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Next 9 months - Project Immersion:</b> Equipped with new skills, you'll join an
                  active research team, tackle real-world problems, and contribute meaningful results—
                  whether through simulations, theoretical modeling, or data analysis.
                </li>
              </ul>
            <p>
              Throughout the entire year you'll collaborate with motivated scientists, expand your
              professional network, and help push the boundaries of scientific knowledge—all while
              benefiting from a structured feedback loop that keeps your growth front and center.
