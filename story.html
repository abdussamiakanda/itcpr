              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>In December 2023, atop the breathtaking Rocky Mountains, two graduate students from Bangladesh studying in the USA found themselves reflecting on a long-standing dream. Surrounded by the serene beauty of nature, we solidified our shared visionâ€”the Institute for Theoretical and Computational Physics Research (ITCPR).</p>
              <p>Our passion for physics and our desire to make research opportunities more accessible have been guiding lights throughout our academic journeys. Over the years, we dreamed of a platform where budding physicists could collaborate, learn, and contribute to pushing the boundaries of knowledge.</p>
              <p>That day in the Rockies, we decided it was time to turn this dream into a reality. ITCPR was born not just as an institute but as a testament to the power of dreams, collaboration, and the enduring spirit of curiosity.</p>
